> **NOTE:** This project is very much in the early stages. What follows below is the ultimate vision for the game.

## About Undefined

**Undefined** is an RPG that adopts a pixel art aesthetic, grounded in a novel concept: every aspect of the game, from story progression and NPC dialogues to world creation and art generation, is dynamically and intelligently crafted by artificial intelligence.

Set in a virtual realm of endless possibilities, Undefined sets itself apart by entrusting its universe to algorithms and machine learning models, ensuring that each player's experience is genuinely unique and perpetually evolving.

Dive into an RPG where tradition meets the bleeding edge, and the limits are only bound by the *AI's* creativity.

## AI Integration Techniques

Undefined is brought to life through several AI systems and custom-built solutions:

### 1. OpenAI API

AI serves as the cornerstone of Undefined, ensuring a living, responsive story environment:

- **AICore System:** Utilizing OpenAI's `gpt-4-1106-preview` model, AICore is the central intelligence that oversees the story arc and reacts to player choices. With a substantial 128k context window, AICore embodies the game's creative mind.
- **AI Agents:** For intricate tasks beyond AICore's scope, agents step in. Whether it requires the speed of `gpt-3.5-turbo` for NPC exchanges or other AI for distinct tasks, these agents flawlessly merge into the game's fabric.
- **DALL-E Models:** For visual allure, Undefined occasionally employs OpenAI's `dalle-...` models to craft in-game art. This sits alongside other proprietary systems conjuring unique graphics for each player's save file, adapting to the game's genre, mood, and environmental context.

### 2. Music Generation

- **MusicGen System:** MusicGen composes chiptune melodies tailored to game scenarios. Initiated by AICore's request, MusicGen interprets guidelines for song theme, instruments, and tempo, producing an auditory backdrop as diverse as the game itself.

### 3. Graphical Generation

- **TilesetGen System:** TilesetGen is tasked with fabricating tilesets that align with the game's setting and genre. By following parameters set by AICore, TilesetGen creates and returns sprite sheets ready for GameMaker's utilization.
- **Terrain Generation:** With combined techniques such as layered 2D noise and stochastic processes, Undefined generates varied terrains, displayed isometrically.
- **Other Generation:** To populate the world, structures and layouts are procedurally generated, adding continuous explorations within Undefined.

### 4. Miscellaneous Systems

Each player's journey within Undefined is encapsulated in save files. These not only retain the dialogues and decisions but preserve the unique world configuration, tilesets, custom images, and an original soundtrack, all generated by AI.

## The Future of Undefined

Please star and watch for updates as Undefined progresses in a quest to redefine the gaming experience.
